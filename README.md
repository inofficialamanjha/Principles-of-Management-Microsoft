# PROJECT ABSTRACT

Henry Fayol, introduced a ‘General Theory of Management’ that can be applied to all levels of management and every department. The theory is practised by the managers to organize and regulate the internal activities of an organization. His concentration was on accomplishing managerial efficiency.

14 Principles of Management as describes by Henri Fayol are:

1.	**Division of Labour**: Specialization of jobs. Work should be divided & subdivided and allotted to various persons according to their area of expertise. It aims to make task simple, enhance its speed and performance overtime.

2.	**Party of Authority & Responsibility**: Authority & Responsibility are co-existing, i.e., if authority is given to a person, he should be made responsible and vice-versa.

Authority refers to the right of superiors to get exactness from their sub-ordinates.
Responsibility means obligation for the performance of the job assigned.

Authority without responsibility leads to irresponsible behaviour whereas responsibility without authority makes the person ineffective.

3.	**Unity of Command**: A Sub-ordinate should receive orders and be accountable to one and only one boss at a time. A person should not receive instructions from more than one person to provide a disciplined, stable & orderly existence.

This can’t be achieved without unity of direction.

4.	**Unity of Direction**: One-head plan for a group of activities having similar objectives. These activities should be under the charge of a particular manager.

According to this principle, efforts of all members should be directed towards common goal. This is to avoid duplication of efforts and wastage of resources.

5.	**Equity**: Combination of fairness, kindness & justice. Similar treatment to people of similar position.

This doesn’t mean total absence of harshness.

6.	**Order**: Proper & Systematic arrangement of things (Material Order) and people (Social order).

Material Order: There should be safe, appropriate and specific place for a specific article, activity and commodity.

Social Order: Selection and appointment of most suitable person on the suitable job. Everyone should have a specific place and a specific department.

7.	**Discipline**: Sub-ordinates should respect their superiors and obey their order for smooth running of the enterprise. To enforce discipline there should be good superiors at all levels, clear & fair agreements between workers and punishments should be applied judiciously.

8.	**Initiative**: Workers should be encouraged to take initiative in the work assigned to them. People can be encouraged to suggest improvement in formulation and implementation, suggest ideas, experiences & new methods with the help of monetary and non-monetary incentives.

9.	**Fair Renumeration**: The quantum and method of renumeration should be fair, reasonable, satisfactory & rewarding of the efforts.

Wages should be determined on the basis of cost of living, work assigned, financial position of business, wage rate prevailing etc.

Fayol also recommended provision of other benefits such as free education, medical & residential facilities to workers.

10.	**Stability of Tenure**: The period of service in a job should be fixed. There should be stability of job, and ample amount of time should be provided to an employee to get used to new work and render worthwhile services. This enhances quality and quantity of work, while creating a sense of belongingness and team spirit.

11.	**Scalar Chain**: There should be a chain of superiors ranging from the ultimate authority to the lowest. Every message should pass through scalar chain.

But for sake of convenience & urgency, a short cut can be taken known as ‘Gang Plank’.

12.	**Sub-Ordination of Individual Interest to General Interest**: Reconciliation should be achieved between individual and group interest as far as possible.

In order to achieve this, employees should be honest & sincere, reconciliation through mutual agreement should be there, and Proper & Regular supervision of work is required. Everyone should work towards the greater interest of the organization.

13.	**Esprit De’ Corps**: It refers to team spirit, harmony and mutual understanding among the members.

Managers should be against dividing employees into competing groups. Face to Face communication should be developed. Managers should infuse team spirit & belongingness. There should be no place for misunderstanding.

Following steps can assure Espirit De’ Corps, Proper coordination of work, development of informal relations, rewards and renumeration for improved and further improvements in performance and a conscious awareness of task significance and social responsibility.

14.	**Centralization & De-Centralization**: Absolute centralization or decentralization is not feasible.

Centralization means concentration of authority at top level.
De-Centralization means disposal of decision making to all levels.

We aim at presenting a Case-Study on Applications of the above principles at Microsoft Corporation.
